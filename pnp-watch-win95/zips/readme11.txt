Short: Free utility (with source code) to watch Windows 95 / NT Plug'n'Play
       events, and report details of such things as PCMCIA cards or CD-ROMs
       being inserted or removed.

Description:
This is a small Windows 95 utility that I have recently discussed on
comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.vxd   Its main value is as example code for
doing useful things with Windows Plug'n'Play events.  (Hence the suggestion
of a new programming subdirectory.)  See the readme.txt and watch.c files
within the archive for guidance on copyright and how the program may be
used and distributed.

It has been tested with Windows 95, and should run on Windows NT with no
problems, (though until Windows NT 5.0 brings Plug'n'Play support it is of
less use there).

This is version 1.1, the first public distribution of this software.
Version 1.0 was only used within my employer's premises.

Best regards,
Anthony Naggs
