Plug and Play notification watcher for MS Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, ...)

This is a small Windows utility, that reports and decodes Plug and Play events as they
happen, e.g.: CD-ROMs being inserted or removed; PCMCIA cards or USB devices being
inserted or removed; connection or removal from a laptop dock; or changes in the
configuration of the Ethernet, modem etc... .

Version 2.0 has been updated & tidied in 2014 for use on newer versions of MS Windows.

Older versions suitable for Windows 95/98 were previously distributed:
1997-11-05 Version 1.1   pnpwat11.zip
1998-11-22 Version 1.2   pnpwat12.zip
